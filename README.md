#  Link & Network Layer Forwarding

## About my code

### Switch

What switches need to do to handle the coming packet is:	

1. Clear the time out entry from the switch table.
2. Add a new entry to the switch table containing information learned from the coming packet.
3. Send packet to the corresponding interface according to the switch table. If there is no record about the exit of the destination MAC address, broadcast it to each interface except the entrance.

Here is some details of my implementation: I create new classes - SwitchEntry and SwitchTable - in order to maintain the switch table and entries. The time I check and delete the timeout entries is before I get a packet and look for the interface to send out.

### Router

What routers need to do to handle the coming packet is:

1. Check whether its type is IPv4.
2. Calculate the checksum and compare to the record in the header of the payload.
3. Check, modify the TTL and discard the timeout packet.
4. Look for the corresponding interface to send out.
5. Modify the header of the packet and send out the new packet.

Here is some details: To find the exit interface, I check each entry of the table and see if it has the longest prefix matching to the destination IP address, which means, I need to find the mask with the smallest absolute value. In addition, because of the modification of TTL, it's necessary to refresh the checksum of the payload in the packet.
